Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will 
help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part 
of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the 
code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so 
remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and 
analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required 
to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, 
in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and 
communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being 
asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet 
so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, 
Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to 
use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are 
lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10,000
ii. Business table = 10,000
iii. Category table = 10,000
iv. Checkin table = 10,000
v. elite_years table = 10,000
vi. friend table = 10,000
vii. hours table = 10,000
viii. photo table = 10,000
ix. review table = 10,000
x. tip table = 10,000
xi. user table = 10,000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. 
If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = id(10,000)
ii. Hours = business_id(1,562)
iii. Category = business_id(2,643)
iv. Attribute = business_id(1,115)
v. Review = business_id(8,090),user_id(1,562), id(10,000)
vi. Checkin = business_id(493)
vii. Photo = business_id(6493), id(10,000)
viii. Tip = id(3,979), user_id(537)
ix. User = id(10,000)
x. Friend = user_id(11)
xi. Elite_years = user_id(2,780)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: NO
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer: Ran the code below on all columns in the table

SELECT 
     *
FROM
     user
WHERE
    compliment_photos IS NULL
	
	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), 
and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1.0		max: 5.0		avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min: 0		max: 2		avg: 0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min: 1		max: 53		avg: 1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min: 0		max: 2000		avg: 24.2995

7. Find the top 3 users based on their total number of reviews:
		
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
SELECT 
    id, name, review_count
FROM
    user
ORDER BY review_count DESC
LIMIT 3
	
		
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

+------------------------+--------+--------------+


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

	No, we can see in the results below that only 1/3 user with the most review
	made it to the top 10 of users with the most fans. That was Gerald.
	
	
SELECT 
    id, name, review_count, fans
FROM
    user

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category 
by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars 
and answer the following questions. Include your code.

SELECT 
	b.id, 
	city, 
	category, 
	stars, 
	hours
FROM 
	business b
	INNER JOIN category c 
		ON  b.id = c.business_id
	INNER JOIN hours h 
		ON c.business_id = h.business_id
WHERE city ='Las Vegas' AND category = 'Shopping'
ORDER BY stars DESC, hours DESC
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
It looks like the location with the lowest star rating also has the most hours opened.
While the second lowest had the shortest hours of 6 hours. So it looks like 8 - 9 hour open
is the ideal hours of operation. To long could lead to poor store conditions and to short could 
lead to customers going else where to shop.

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
It looks like the location that is open 8.5 hours also has the most reviews.
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences 
can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least 
two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
Locations that are open have 8,480 reviews compared to 1,520 reviews for closed locations        
         
ii. Difference 2:
The number of locations with ratings 3.0 + is significantly higher compared to ratings below 3.0

ORDER BY 4 DESC, stars DESC
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to 
conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, 
clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating 
for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples 
to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. 
Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do: 

I want to analysis 5 keywords that would indicate a good
review (excellent, perfect, best, amazing, wonderful) and 5 keywords that indicate a bad review (terrible,poor,awful, worst, avoid)
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

In this analysis I wanted to see the average rating based on 5 positive and 5 negative keywords. I then wanted 
to see how many reviews were being left and see if the users had a high number of fans as well. Since we wont want
more negative reviews being left from user with high fan count. What I found was that more positive reviews were 
being left compared to negative. The positive reviews have 54 fans compared to zero fans from the negative reviews.

More positive reviews will be seen by more people so aim to get more positive reviews.       
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

(excellent, perfect, best, amazing, wonderful)

 NumberOfReviews | NumberOfFans | AvgRating |
+-----------------+--------------+-----------+
|            1081 |           54 |      4.12 |
+-----------------+--------------+-----------+

(terrible, poor, awful, worst, avoid)

| NumberOfReviews | NumberOfFans | AvgRating |
+-----------------+--------------+-----------+
|              13 |            0 |       2.4 |
+-----------------+--------------+-----------+

iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

SELECT 
    SUM(review_count) AS NumberOfReviews,
    SUM(fans) AS NumberOfFans,
    AVG(stars) AS NumberOfFans
